# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview 
### Purpose 
The purpose of the project is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. First, I created the retirement titles table which holds all the titles of the current employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. Then using Distinct on statement I created another table that hold the most recent titles of employees, then finally using count statement I created the final table named retiring titles which holds the number of employees and their most recent job title who are about to retire. 
To identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship progrem, I created a mentorship-eligibility table that holds the current employees who were born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965.

### Results:
- There are 90,398 employees out of 300,024 who are eligible for retirement.
- From the table retiring_titles we can see that most of the employees who are eligible for retirement are employees with senior on their job title.

Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
### Summary:
   Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
  
  
        
  How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
       
  Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
