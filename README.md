# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview 
### Purpose 
The purpose of the project is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. First, I created the retirement titles table which holds all the titles of the current employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. Then using Distinct on statement I created another table that hold the most recent titles of employees, then finally using count statement I created the final table named retiring titles which holds the number of employees and their most recent job title who are about to retire. 
To identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship progrem, I created a mentorship-eligibility table that holds the current employees who were born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965.

### Results:
- There are 90,398 employees out of 300,024 who are eligible for retirement.
- The unique titles table that I created shows the most recent title for employees of retirment age.
- From the table retiring_titles we can see that most of the employees who are eligible for retirement are employees with senior on their job title.

- There are only 1940 employees who are eligible for mentorship program.


### Summary:

- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Since 30% of the total employees are eligible for retirement there will be lots of positions to fill specially senior engineer, senior staff, Engineer, and staff. 
The least number of position to fill is manager position with only 2 are retiring.
- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
Yes. I think there are really qualified employees to train new employees because most of the employees that are retiring are in senior position through promotion during their working career.
